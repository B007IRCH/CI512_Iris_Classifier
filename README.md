# CI512_Iris_Classifier
The Iris Classifier script classifies flowers from the Iris dataset using a feedforward neural network. It preprocesses data, applies one-hot encoding, trains a TensorFlow model, evaluates performance via classification reports/confusion matrices, and visualizes training with accuracy and loss graphs.

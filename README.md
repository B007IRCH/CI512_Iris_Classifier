# CI512_Iris_Classifier
The Iris Classifier script is designed to classify different species of flowers using the Iris dataset, a popular dataset for multi-class classification. This script includes:

Functionality:

Loads and preprocesses the Iris dataset, including one-hot encoding of the target variable.
Implements a feedforward neural network with two hidden layers optimized for tabular data.
Evaluates the model's performance with metrics like classification reports and confusion matrices.
Visualizes the training process through graphs of accuracy and loss for training and validation datasets.
Features:

Uses TensorFlow for neural network implementation and training.
Handles zipped datasets and allows dataset browsing.
Supports multi-class classification (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).
Use Case:

Highlights neural network capabilities on small, structured datasets.
Demonstrates multi-class classification with compact and interpretable results.
